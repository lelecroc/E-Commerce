# E-Commerce

## Our aim

This is a group project made to test our knowledge and skill with Vue.js. We chose an e-commerce project that sells pokemon related items because this brand fits well with this concept.

## What tools did we use

We used the latest version of Vue.js and Tailwind. We created 2 .json files.

## Coding Rules

- Our code is in English to provide the best experience for everyone;
- We followed the CamelCase convention;
- The skeleton of the .vue pages always follows this structure: 1. Script, 2. Template, 3.Style;
- Our comments will always be on one line;

## Roadmap

After the "release" we will implement a "Vuekedex" page and another page where the user can see his/hers favourite items
